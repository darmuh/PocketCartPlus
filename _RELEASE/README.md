# PocketCart Plus

### Improve the Pocket Cart with new upgrades! When upgraded, the cart has new functionality like keeping items in the cart when it's stored in your inventory  

This mod is intended for use by all clients in a lobby. Currently, this mod provides **one** upgrade that can be purchased in the shop that will enhance the pocket cart.  

### Upgrades List
**Pocket C.A.R.T. Upgrade - Keep Items**  
	- When the pocket cart is stored, will store any items in the cart alongside it.  
	- Configurable to be a shared upgrade or by individual.  
**(PLANNED) Pocket C.A.R.T. Size Increase**  
	- When purchased by a player, will increase the base size of the pocket cart.  

### Configuration Options Explained

Debug: ``Developer Logging``  
    - This will allow you to see logging used to debug the mod.  
    - Enable this if you run into an issue you can reproduce and submit the new logs with your bug report.  
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Unlock without Upgrade``  
    - Enable this if you want this upgrade to automatically be unlocked without having to buy it from the shop. (Host Only)  
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Minimum Price``  
    - This will set the minimum base-price of the Keep Items Upgrade  
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Maximum Price``  
    - This will set the maximum base-price of the Keep Items Upgrade 
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Rarity Percentage (Add-on)``
    - This is an added-on rarity percentage that is calculated before the shop initializes.
    - Set to 100% if you do not wish for added rarity.
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Shared Unlock``  
    - This will make the unlock shared. So if one player unlocks it all will have the upgrade.  
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Ignore Enemies``  
    - When enabled, this will make it so enemies cannot be stored with the cart.  
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Player Safety Check``  
    - When disabled, a tumbled player can fall to their death when stored with the cart.  
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Cart Stabilization Timer``  
    - This timer is the amount of time items wait for the cart to stabilize before returning to their original scale.  
Keep Items Upgrade: ``Item Safety Timer``
